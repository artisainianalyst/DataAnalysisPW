    "  * In Python, iterators and iterables are fundamental concepts for working with sequences of data.\n",
    "  1. Iterables:\n",
    "   An iterable is an object that can be iterated over, meaning you can loop through its elements. Common examples of iterables include lists, tuples, strings, and dictionaries. An object is considered an iterable if it implements the __iter__() method, which returns an iterator. \n",
    "  2. Iterators:\n",
    "  An iterator is an object that represents a stream of data. It is used to traverse through the elements of an iterable one at a time. An iterator must implement two methods: \n",
    "  1. __iter__(): This method returns the iterator object itself.\n",
    "  2. __next__(): This method returns the next item from the sequence. If there are no more items, it raises a StopIteration exception. \n",
    "  * Differences between Iterables and Iterators:\n",
    "    \n",
    "  1. Purpose: An iterable is a container of elements that can be iterated over, while an iterator is an object that performs the iteration over an  iterable.\n",
    "  2. Methods: Iterables primarily implement __iter__(), while iterators implement both __iter__() and __next__().\n",
    "  3. State: Iterators maintain an internal state to keep track of the current position during iteration, allowing them to return the \"next\" element. Iterables do not inherently maintain this iteration state.\n",
    "  4. Relationship: Every iterator is also an iterable (because it implements __iter__()), but not every iterable is an iterator (as it may not implement __next__()). You can obtain an iterator from an iterable using the built-in iter() function.\n",

    "   * The primary advantages of using generators over regular functions in Python are centered around memory efficiency and the ability to handle large or infinite sequences.\n",
    "  1. Memory Efficiency:\n",
    "Lazy Evaluation: Generators employ \"lazy evaluation,\" meaning they produce values one by one only when requested. In contrast, a regular function that returns a list or other collection will construct the entire collection in memory before returning it. This makes generators ideal for processing large datasets that might not fit entirely into memory.\n",
    "Reduced Memory Footprint: By yielding values iteratively instead of storing them all, generators significantly reduce the memory footprint, particularly when dealing with extensive data streams or infinite sequences.\n",
    "  2. Handling Large and Infinite Sequences:\n",
    "Processing Large Datasets: Generators can efficiently process datasets that are too large to load into memory entirely, such as lines in a massive file or database records.\n",
    "Infinite Sequences: Generators can represent infinite sequences, as they generate values on demand and do not require the entire sequence to be materialized in memory. This is not possible with regular functions that return a complete sequence.\n",
    "  3. Simpler Implementation of Iterators:\n",
    "Automatic Iterator Protocol: When you use the yield keyword within a function, Python automatically handles the implementation of the iterator protocol (__iter__() and __next__()), making it simpler to create custom iterators compared to writing a full-fledged class.\n",
    "  4. Pipelining Operations:\n",
    "Chaining Generators: Multiple generators can be chained together to create processing pipelines, where the output of one generator serves as the input for the next. This allows for efficient, memory-friendly data transformation.\n",
