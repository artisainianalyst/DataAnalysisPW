    "   1. Implicit Type Casting: Python automatically converts one data type to another without explicit user intervention.\n",

    "  *Purpose of Conditional Statements:> The purpose of conditional statements in Python is to enable decision-making within a program, \n",

    "  flow,making it dynamic and responsive to varying inputs or states.\n",
    "      \n",
    "     *Key aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Controlling program flow:> Conditional statements such as if , if-else , and if-elif-else direct the program to follow different paths of\n",
    "execution depending on the evaluation of a condition.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   2. Decision-Making :> They allow programs to make choices for executing specific actions only when certain criteria are met. \n",
    "       Example: A program might check if a user is old enough to access a feature and grant or deny access accordingly. \n",
    "       \n",
    "   3. Handling Multiple Scenarios :> If-elif-else constructs are particularly useful for handling multiple  mutually exclusive conditions,\n",
    "    ensuring that only one specific block of code is executed among several possibilities.\n",
    "        \n",
    "   4. Implementing Logic:> Conditional statements are fundamental for implementing complex logical structures within a program, allowing it to respond\n",
    "    intelligently to different situations and data. \n",
